#Rock-Paper-Scissors 
##Makers Academy Week 7 Task


###Aim

The aim of this task was to introduce us to JavaScript. Using TDD, we had to implement the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors

It provided good practice of Cucumber/Capybara BDD approaches.

###Other details

The task was set by Alex Peattie, [@alexpeattie](http://www.github.com/alexpeattie)

I paired with Arturo Ortiz, [@elsushi](http://www.github.com/elsushi)


###Features

The site contains a basic webpage, where the user plays against the computer. A message is printed after each turn saying which object the computer chose, and then announcing the winner.

There is a counter on the page which keeps a tally of the scores.

The app was built using Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS

###To do


* Further refactoring of the code
* Use Ajax to allow for saving of game progress
* Have a finite ending of the game where a certain number of points is reached
* Print out gameplay statistics at the end of a game
